when taileing processes our source css file it uses a deafult cofigurstion to do that under the hood

this configuration dictates the values of peroperties controlled by different classes that we use in our html
ex: text-sm would give a font size of 0.875rem or red-500 color should be a specific hex code etc.,

we can also create our own tailwind config file to eithet extend those rules or  add extra classes for fonts or colrs or spacig or anthing else
or to change the curent ones as well 

npx tailwindcss init --full(creates a config fies with default valus)

we can change the default styles that tailwind provides

like in tailwind config file if we add a property mammoth:3px, for font-size prperty than afyer processing src styles.css we can use text-mammoth property
like this we can cahneg adn add new pripertues, but it is not recommended to cahneg the default settings in tailwind config

so fpr this, in tailwind config file w ehave a extend property for theme property,
so in the extend property, we can add our custome propertis like
colors:{
  primary:"#FF6363",
  secondary:{
   100: "#E2E2DS",
   200: "#888883"
  }
}
rebuild the css and then apply the styles to the element in html

vs code extension: tailwindcss intellisince
