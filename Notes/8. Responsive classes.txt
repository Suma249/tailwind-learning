normally when we are creating mobie designs we would use media queries in css to style things differently accordsing to system sizes

in tailwind we dont have to do that, but we can just prefix tailwind classes with resposnive classes and then that class woud only apply to that screen size

mobile first approach
ex: class="flex justify-center md:justify-end", here first small screen justify-center property is appied which is first and if the screen is medium than jsutify -end is applied
ex:
text-green-500 sm:text-red-500 lg:text-blue-500 text-sm
